# Kaggle-House-Price-Prediction
This is an ongoing kaggle competition where given 79 attributes we have to develope a model that by using those variables predicts the price of the House:https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques


In this Project I used feature engineering to treat the missing values, treated ouliers by capping the outlier using quantiles.
Used XG boost and Lasso regression for the final prediction by using linear combination of both the models.
